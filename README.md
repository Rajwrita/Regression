# Regression
Data on two variables recorded simultaneously for a group of individuals are called bivariate data. Examples of bivariate data are heights and weights of the students in a class, the rainfall and the yield of paddy in a state for several consecutive years, etc.

When we have bivariate data, we can, no doubt, consider the values of each variable separately to know the different measures like the mean and standard deviation of the variable; but here we are mainly concerned with two other problems.
Firstly, we want to study the nature and extent of association, if any, between the variables. Secondly, if the variables are found to be associated we express one of them (regarded as the dependent variable) as a mathematical function of the other (considered as an independent variable), so that we can predict the value of the dependent variable when the value of the independent variable is known. The first problem is called correlation analysis and the second regression analysis. 

### What is Linear Regression?
To find the relationship between continuous correlated variables we use linear regression. Linear regression looks for a statistical  relationship between a set of correlated values. The representation is a linear equation that combines a specific set of input values (x) the solution to which is the predicted output for that set of input values (y). As such, both the input values (x) and the output value are numeric. When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression. When there are multiple input variables,the method is referred to as multiple linear regression.

### What is Polynomial Regression?
Linear Regression works on data where the dependent and independent variable have a linear relationship. But in cases where the data do not have a linear relationship and instead possess a rather complex relationship, then Polynomial Regression is used.

Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x).
